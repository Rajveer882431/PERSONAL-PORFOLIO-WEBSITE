DESCRIPTION: This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS to showcase my work as a frontend web developer. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate single-page website that introduces me and highlights the projects I've built.

The site starts with a simple navigation bar that remains fixed at the top, allowing users to jump smoothly between sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The Home section gives a brief intro with a welcoming message. The About section shares a few lines about who I am, my passion for web development, and what I love building.

The Projects section displays some of my key work, including a real-time chat app, an interactive quiz game, and even this portfolio itself. Each project is shown in a card layout with a brief description, and the design adapts nicely to screen size, making it mobile-friendly.

In the Contact section, visitors can find my email and GitHub link to get in touch or explore my code. Lastly, a simple footer wraps up the page with a copyright.

What makes this project special is its simplicity and personal touch. It’s minimal yet functional, and it’s a solid foundation to build on in the future—whether by adding JavaScript interactivity, animations, or integrating a backend.

Overall, this project reflects both my personality and development style—clean, user-focused, and thoughtfully designed.
